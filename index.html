      <h2>About us</h2>
      <p>We are a peaceful, family run campground short before Mostar.</p>
      <p>
        Located directly at the river Buna with a beautiful view of the
        mountains, we are happy to welcome you!
        <br />
        We are locals and know the area very well and we are happy to supply you
        with information about all the interesting sights close by. You can go
        swimming in the river, rent kayaks close by or simply relax and enjoy
        the beautiful landscape all around the camp. The camp is simple (we try
        to keep things as natural as possible) and has space for around 40
        campers as well as tents.
        <br />
        The camp is open from April to October.
