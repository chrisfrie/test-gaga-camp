## About us

We are a peaceful, family run campground short before Mostar.

Located directly at the river Buna with a beautiful view of the mountains, we are happy to welcome you!

We are locals and know the area very well and we are happy to supply you with information about all the interesting sights close by. You can go
swimming in the river, rent kayaks close by or simply relax and enjoy the beautiful landscape all around the camp. The camp is simple (we try to
keep things as natural as possible) and has space for around 40 campers as well as tents.

The camp is open from April to October.
